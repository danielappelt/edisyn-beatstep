<h1>Waldorf Microwave II / XT / XTk</h1> 
<h2>Multi Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf Microwave II,</b> the <b>Waldorf Microwave XT,</b> and the <b>Waldorf Microwave XTk</b> in 10 voice or in 30 voice.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your Microwave to send <b>Sysex only</b>, not <b>Ctl</b> nor <b>Ctl+Sysex.</b>  Also set <b>Receive</b> to on.

<p><b>Show</b> Each Instrument has a button called <b>Show</b>.  This shows the given sound (bank and number) as a separate
Blofeld Single editor panel.

<p><b>XTk Options</b> Two options are only available for the Microwave XTk:

<ul>
<li><b>MIDI Send</b> (In General) Set this to <i>Global</i> to send MIDI on all instruments regardless of their individual settings.  Set this to <i>Specific</i> to allow individual instruments to specify whether they want their MIDI sent.
<p><li><b>MIDI Send</b> (In each Instrument) determines whether a given instrument will send its MIDI out.  This is overridden by the General option above.
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b> There are a few:

<ul>

<li>Edisyn cannot tell the Microwave to switch to a given multi patch number via a program change.  As a result, when you request a patch, Edisyn will receive the patch but the Microwave will continue to play the old patch.  Solution: after receiving the patch, issue <b>Send To Current Patch</b> to update the Microwave.  For a similar reason, <b>Send To Patch</b> is disabled.

<p><li>Though the Microwave responds to individual parameter changes in Multimode, it does not send any parameter change sysex when you turn its knobs.

<p><li>Also, when you make individual parameter changes, the Microwave's screen won't update to reflect those changes: but they've been made.  Try scrolling away and then back, and you'll see the changes magically appear.
</ul>

<p><b>Fun Feature</b> When your patch editor becomes the front window, it'll ask the Microwave to change to Multi mode automatically.
